# capstone-cloud-devops-project5

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p> In this project, I applied the skills and knowledge which was developed throughout the Cloud DevOps Nanodegree program. These include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Working in AWS</li>
	<li>Using Jenkins to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment</li>
	<li>Building pipelines</li>
	<li>Working with Ansible and CloudFormation to deploy clusters</li>
	<li>Building Kubernetes clusters</li>
	<li>Building Docker containers in pipelines</li>
</ul>


<p>I developed a CI/CD pipeline for microservices applications with rolling deployment. I developed Continuous Integration steps, such as typographical checking (aka “linting”). I also developed Contiguous Deployment steps. These includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Pushing the built Docker containers to the Docker repository</li>
	<li>Deploying these Docker containers to a small Kubernetes cluster. For Kubernetes cluster I used AWS EKS. To deploy my Kubernetes cluster using Cloudformation. I ran these from Jenkins as an independent pipeline.</li>
</ul>
